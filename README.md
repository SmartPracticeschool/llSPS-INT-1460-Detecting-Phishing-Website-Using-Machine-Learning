Detecting Phishing Website Using Machine Learning
We used a dataset from kaggle.com and performed phishing websites detection using Machine Learning algorithms.
We performed Data pre-processing,checked out for any missed values in the data,trained and tested the data,performed feature scaling on it.
We built an model by applying different machine learning classifiers and calculated accuracy of them.
Among different machine learning classifiers we used,Random Forest gave us the highest accuracy.
Next,we performed the application building using HTML and Python.
